Reflection

This was a weekend project built for a react asessment test. Project goals was to finish the given task in stipulated time with certain features and technologies of react to be used.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Routing. This lead me to spend a few hours on a research spike into how react router changed from v-5 to v-6. I was able to make it work after a little diligent reading.

I designed the app as to fetch data when initially on component mount

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 6.0 and a significant amount of JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
